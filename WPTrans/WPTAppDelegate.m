    // the top twenty languages by speakers (note that's *total* speakers, not
    // *native* speakers) from the list at
    // http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size which
    // itself is a source on the Wikipedia article "List of languages by total
    // number of speakers." Each language was then inexpertly matched up with
    // the Wikipedia language code equivalent. The list is flawed for our use
    // case, since:
    // - "Speakers" is not necessarily equivalent to "readers"
    // - The actual usage data for those that use this app will probably differ
    //   (perhaps more people are using this app to look up words in Dutch or
    //   Swahili than Telugu and Tamil)
    // - Probably many other reasons I have yet to consider
    // â€¦but for the lack of any other better lists at the moment, here we go.
