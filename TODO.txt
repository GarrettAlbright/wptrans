In no particular orderâ€¦

- Language enable/disable screen should display as a modal.
- No more compiler warnings. =[
- Traditional Chinese support.
  - If you're not aware as to why this is problematic, the short story is that
    Wikipedia doesn't have separate zh-hans and zh-hant versions; they have a
    single zh version which uses software to automatically translate between
    the two. If you send a HTTP request to the zh Wikipedia for an article and
    don't ask for zh-hant in the Accept-Language header, Wikipedia sends you zh-
    hans. I suspect, internally, everything is stored in zh-hans, but I'm not
    sure. At least for our purposes, there doesn't seem to be a way to get
    article titles in zh-hant using the API (that I can recall), but even if
    it were possible, supporting both zh-hant and zh-hans would involve making
    two separate queries! Perhaps the solution here is to (gulp) implement zh-
    hant translation client-side.
- Result bookmarking.
- iPad form factor support.
